## Overview
I started this project from the Desktop design and got very stuck, then learned how to do a media query to make it mobile compatible. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
I started out with the desktop design, got stuck and reached out on Slack and got great feedback which I implemented. I researced a ton more to finally understand how to take my grid design to a mobile size. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned a lot more about Grid layouts and got a slightly better grasp on media queries. I read tons of articles and watched a number of youTube videos and feel like I'm understanding a bit more! 

### Continued development

I have a lot more studying to do on CSS and look forward to having a better understanding with each project that I do! 

### Useful resources

the most useful videos I found were Kevin Powell on youTube (https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)
